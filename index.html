    <h2>How To Play</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Once you begin the game you will see a set of cards flipped downwards
        <br>
        <br>
        You will need to select a card and it will show you a color
        <br>
        <br>
        You will need to find where the other version of that card is on the board by selecting a second card
        <br>   
        <br>
        Once you get a match the cards will stay open as a matched set
        <br>
        <br>
        Match all the cards to each other to move on to the next level
